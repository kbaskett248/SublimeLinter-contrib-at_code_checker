This version deprecates the bundled version of AT Code Checker that
comes with this extension. The Linter will now prefer the official version of 
AT Code Checker installed with the mtad. 

The mtad version is installed at C:\Program Files (x86)\MEDITECH\M-AT Tools\M-AT_Code_Checker.
If you do not have this installation, you can follow the installation
instructions at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQFGeg9pmIFmmQr2CPjIwRI_A4_LdhfRXwhWcJ3nM9s/edit.
You only need to follow steps 1 and 2. After doing so, updating AT Code Checker
is as simple as running the mtad again.

This will make it easier to use the most up-to-date version of AT Code Checker,
and it will shrink the size of this extension.

The bundled version will continue to be included for the next few months to
provide time for everyone to transition.
